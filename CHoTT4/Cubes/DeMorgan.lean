/- We introduce the free deMorgan algebra over a direction set by describing the elements and
   algebraic operations explicitly and then proving the axioms and (universal) properties
   of a (free) deMorgan algebra, instead of constructing it as an instance of a general
   structure and construction, with the axioms and properties implied.

   The reason is that we do not need other (free) de Morgan algebras, with the possible
   exception of subalgebras of the free DeMorgan algebras over direction sets. In that way,
   we also follow the model of introducing natural numbers: They form certainly a
   semiring, but the properties of their algebraic operations are proven from scratch. -/
